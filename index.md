# Geometry, Representation Theory and Physics Workshop - Barcelona 2022

This workshop is meant to give a formal introduction to relevant topics in geometry and representation applied to physics, like Deformation Theory or Higher Spin Theory. For this purpose, we invited young researcher in these domains to give 3 to 4 hour long lectures during the last week of July 2022. In between lectures, there will be special speakers that will talk about more specific subjects like the geometry of AdS or the dynamics of AdS/CFT. 

This free-to-enter workshop is targeted towards young researchers in mathemtics, mathematical physics or theoretical physics but can be enjoyed by anyone interested on theses domain.

## Planning
The workshop will be taking place from the 25th to the 29th of July, from 9h00 to 13h00 and from 15h00 to 18h00 (GTM+2).

In the next weeks a specific planning will be uploaded.

Roberto Emparan is ICREA research professor at the Institute of Cosmos Sciences of the University of Barcelona since 2003. He received his PhD from the University of the Basque Country in 1995, and then held postdoctoral positions at UC Santa Barbara, Durham University, and CERN. His research lies at the interface between General Relativity and String Theory, focusing on the classical, quantum, and stringy properties of black holes in different numbers of dimensions, subjects on which he has authored more than 120 articles. In 2016 he received an Advanced Grant of the European Research Council. In 2022 he has been elected Fellow the International Society of General Relativity and Gravitation. He is a member of the editorial board of Living Reviews in Relativity, Journal of High Energy Physics, and Advances in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics. In his talk he will describe some of the geometric features that underlie the AdS/CFT correspondence, which provides a holographic quantum theory of gravity.

### David Mateos. Dynamical aspects in AdS/CFT
Finished a Ph.D. in Spacetime physics from worldvolume branes at the University of Barcelona back in 2000 and is now an ICREA Research Professor at the Department of Quantum Physics and Astrophysics, ICCUB, at the University of Barcelona. His research interests center around the classical and quantum physics of Black Holes and gauge/string duality and quantum chromodynamics. In his talk, he will talk about…



### Thomas Basile. Introduction to deformation quantization of Poisson manifolds
He is now starting his second PostDoc on Higher spin Gravity at the University of Mons. His interests include algebraic aspects of higher spin gravity, deformation quantization, and its relation to topological sigma models. He will introduce the deformation quantization of Poisson manifolds — which consists in deforming the structure of the associative algebra of the algebra of functions on a Poisson manifold — and the formality theorem due to Kontsevitch.



### Simon Pekar. Introduction to Higher spin theory
He obtained his master’s degree in high-energy physics from the École Polytechnique, Paris, and ETH Zürich. He is currently a Ph.D. in UMONS. He is interested mainly in algebra and geometry, asymptotic symmetries, holography, higher-spin theories, and Carrollian physics. He will discuss the symmetries of higher-spin gravity theories, which are classical theories of gravity including gauge fields with spin strictly greater than two, and what are the applications of symplectic geometry and deformation quantization to this topic



### Josh'O'Connor. Affine algebra & Kaco moody
Ph.D. student of theoretical physics at the University of Mons in Belgium. His previous studies focused on pure mathematics and, later, theoretical physics. Some academic interests of him include Kac-Moody algebras, dualization, mixed-symmetry fields, and algebraic structure in physics. He will focus on the elementary structure theory of Lie algebras and, more generally, Kac-Moody algebras and its relations with physics. 



### Tung Tran. Deformation of complex structures
PostDoc student at the University of MONS. His research focuses on higher-spin theories and twistor theory. He is also interested in deformation theory, and he will be talking about the deformation of complex structures on complex manifolds based on the Kodaira-Spencer theory, which has significant applications in twistor theory. In particular, he will show how the deformation of twistor geometry can lead to various self-dual theories on spacetime via the Penrose transform.



### Mattia Serrani. _Higher Spin algebras_
He obtained a Master’s degree in Theoretical Physics at the University of Pisa respectively in December 2020 with the thesis "Tree-level spectrum of supergravity on AdS_3 x S^3 form Lorentzian inversion formula”. He is interested in Higher spin gravity, Higher spin algebras, Gauge theories, Constrained Hamiltonian Systems, AdS/CFT, 3d-CS theories, Geometry, and Scattering Amplitudes. In his talk, he wants to create a bridge between math and physics regarding the study of higher spin algebras.



### Ismaël Lahlali Ahlouche. _Kirillov’s orbit method_

Master student in theoretical physics at the University of Mons. He is interested in mathematical physics, Poisson geometry, representation theory, and quantization of classical systems. He will talk about Kirillov’s orbit method to classify the unitary representation of certain Lie groups.

### Anna Blanco Cabanillas. _Topics p-adic representation theory_

<img src="Images/fotoDNI.png" width="200"/>

She graduated with a double Bachelor’s in mathematics and physics at the University of Barcelona last February. Her interests are p-adic representations of Galois groups, algebraic methods in number theory, and applications of Langland's program in physics. She will introduce p-adic representation theory.

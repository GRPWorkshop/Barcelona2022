            <h4>Ivano Basile. String theory and characters</h4>
            <p>Ivano Basile obtained his PhD at Scuola Normale Superiore, 
               Pisa, under the supervision of Augusto Sagnotti. He worked 
               on supersymmetry breaking in string theory. Currently he is 
               a postdoctoral researcher at UMONS, and will join the string 
               theory group at LMU and Max Planck Institute in Munich in 
               the fall. His academic interest string theory, holography, 
               swampland program.
               The plan of this talk is to introduce strings in flat spacetime, 
               focusing on the representation theory of the free spectrum. 
               The consistency conditions on these spectra are reflected in 
               the remarkable modular properties of the corresponding partition 
               functions, and lead to just a handful of possible consistent models, 
               among which the celebrated superstrings in ten dimensions.

        <article id="thomas" class = "lecturer">
            <h4>Thomas Basile. Introduction to deformation quantization of Poisson manifolds</h4>
            <p>Thomas Basile is starting his secod PostDoc on Higher spin Gravity 
                at the University of Mons. His interests include algebraic aspects 
                of higher spin gravity, deformation quantization, and its relation 
                to topological sigma models.

                The lectures that he will provide is about deformation quantizaton 
                of Poisson maniolds. The latter consists in deforming the structure 
                of associative algebra of the algebra of functions on a Poisson 
                manifold. He will also discuss the so-called formality theorem. 
                More precisely, we will discuss the precise content of the formality 
                theorem, and explain how it implies the existence of a deformation 
                quantization for all Poisson manifolds.</p>

        <article id="anna" class = "lecturer">
            <h4>Anna Blanco Cabanillas. Classification of plane Cremona maps</h4>
            <p>She graduated with a double Bachelor’s in mathematics and physics at 
                the University of Barcelona last February. Her interests are p-adic 
                representations of Galois groups, algebraic methods in number theory, 
                and applications of Langland's program in physics.

                Plane cremona maps are mappings between projective planes with some special properties. 
                The classification of those type of maps are an important tool in algebraic geometry. In this talks we will 
                introduce key ideas in the field of algebraic geometry and then dive a little more into the particular case 
                of plane Cremona maps.</p>

        <article id="emparan" class = "lecturer">
            <h4>Roberto Emparan. Geometric Aspects in AdS/CFT</h4>
            <p>Roberto Emparan is ICREA research professor at the Institute of 
                Cosmos Sciences of the University of Barcelona since 2003. He 
                received his PhD from the University of the Basque Country in 
                1995, and then held postdoctoral positions at UC Santa Barbara, 
                Durham University, and CERN. His research lies at the interface 
                between General Relativity and String Theory, focusing on the 
                classical, quantum, and stringy properties of black holes in 
                different numbers of dimensions, subjects on which he has 
                authored more than 120 articles. In 2016 he received an 
                Advanced Grant of the European Research Council. In 2022 
                he has been elected Fellow the International Society of 
                General Relativity and Gravitation. He is a member of 
                the editorial board of Living Reviews in Relativity, Journal 
                of High Energy Physics, and Advances in Theoretical and 
                Mathematical Physics.

                In his talk he will describe some of the geometric features 
                that underlie the AdS/CFT correspondence, which provides a 
                holographic quantum theory of gravity. He will discuss, at a 
                very elementary level, how several particular properties of 
                the geometry of Anti-deSitter space suggest the possibility 
                that a theory with conformal invariance exists at its boundary 
                – not a proof of the AdS/CFT correspondence, but a necessary 
                condition for it. I will then discuss how the long-distance 
                (infinite size) divergences in AdS can be interpreted as 
                short-distance (ultraviolet) divergences in a quantum conformal 
                theory.</p>

        <article id="josh" class = "lecturer">
            <h4>Josh'O'Connor. Kac-Moody algebras and physics</h4>
            <p>Josh O’Connor is a PhD student of theoretical physics at the 
                University of Mons in Belgium. His previous studies focused 
                on pure mathematics and, later, theoretical physics. Some of 
                his interests include Kac-Moody algebras, dualisation, 
                mixed-symmetry fields and algebraic structure in physics.

                He will provide lectures which will focus on the elementary 
                structure theory of Lie algebras and, more generally, Kac-Moody 
                algebras. Also, some relationships between physics and these 
                algebras will be discussed.</p>

        <article id="mateos" class = "lecturer">
            <h4>David Mateos. Dynamical aspects in AdS/CFT</h4>
            <p>David Mateos obtained his PhD from the University of Barcelona 
                in 2000. After that he held postdoctoral positions at Cambridge 
                University, Perimeter Institute and the University of California 
                at Santa Barbara. He has been an ICREA Research Professor at the 
                Institute of Cosmos Sciences at the University of Barcelona since 
                July 2008. In 2012 he was awarded a Starting Grant from the 
                European Research Council. His main goal is to understand the 
                physics of the Universe at the most fundamental level. This 
                requires a unified, quantum theory of all interactions. For this 
                reason he works on string theory, a quantum theory that has the 
                potential to describe all forces and particles in Nature in a 
                single, unified framework.

                In this talk he will describe some dynamical aspects of the 
                AdS/CFT correspondence, possibly the most important development 
                in theoretical physics in the last 25 years.</p>

        <article id="mundet" class = "lecturer">
            <h4>Ignasi Mundet. Groups acting on manifolds: finite groups vs Lie groups</h4>
            <p>Ignasi Mundet is Associate Professor at the University of Barcelona.
            A recurrent topic in his research is the notion of group actions
            on manifolds. Group actions have quite different flavors depending on
            the sort of group that is acting (compact connected Lie group, complex
            reductive Lie group, gauge group, finite group, etc) and on the geometry of
            the manifold that supports the action (topological, smooth, Kaehler, or
            Riemannian manifolds, algebraic varieties, etc). Trying to compare actions
            of different sorts of groups on the same manifold usually leads to nice
            problems. In my talk I plan to discuss the relation between finite group
            actions and actions of compact connected Lie groups, mainly (but not only)
            on topological manifolds. If a manifold supports an action of the circe,
            then it also supports an action of any finite cyclic group, because any
            finite cyclic group is a subgroup of the circle. Is the converse
            true? In general no. However, I will explain some results which roughly
            speaking imply that if a manifold supports actions of finite groups which
            are very big in an appropriate sense, then it also supports actions of tori.</p>

        <article id="naranjo" class = "lecturer">
            <h4>Joan Carles Naranjo. Rationality problems in Algebraic Geometry</h4>
            <p>Joan Carles Naranjo is a permanent researcher at the University of 
                Barcelona since 1993. He is also a member of the Centre de Recerca 
                Matemàtica. His area of expertise is Algebraic Geometry, more
                specifically he works on Abelian varieties, algebraic curves, 
                irregular varieties and cycle theory.

                A rational variety is an algebraic variety which is birational to 
                an affine space. It is a hard and fundamental problem to recognize 
                which varieties are rational. Historically, rationality problems 
                have been of great importance in Algebraic Geometry and have 
                motivated fundamental developments, as the theory of Riemann 
                surfaces, and the Abel–Jacobi map. Castelnuovo’s solution of the 
                so-called Lüroth problem in dimension 2 and the counterexamples 
                to the Lüroth problem in dimension 3 are milestones in the 
                development of the area. The aim of the talk is to give an 
                elementary survey to some old and new methods used in this 
                context.</p>

        <article id="simon" class = "lecturer">
            <h4>Simon Pekar. Higher-spin diffeomorphisms </h4>
            <p>Simon Pekar is a PhD student at University of Mons. His academic 
                interest consists in algebra, geometry, asymptotic symmetries, 
                holography, higher-spin theories and Carrollian physics.

                During the lectures we will discuss the symmetries of higher-spin 
                gravity theories, which are classical theories of gravity, 
                including gauge fields with spin strictly greater than two. 
                In particular, we will take a look at higher-spin diffeomorphisms 
                that are gauge transformations of those fields. After a review 
                of higher-spin theories and the representation of their algebra 
                of infinitesimal gauge transformations, we discuss in details 
                the obstructions to the lift of these representations to those 
                of a group. We also explain how to bypass this problem by 
                elaborating on results from symplectic geometry and deformation 
                quantization.</p>

        <article id="mattia" class = "lecturer">
            <h4>Mattia Serrani. Higher Spin algebras</h4>
            <p>Mattia Serrani did his Master in Theoretical Physics at the University 
                of Pisa in December 2020. Currently he is a PhD Student at University 
                of Mons. His interest is mainly in physics and pure math, more 
                precisely, in Higher spin algebras, Constrained Hamiltonian Systems, 
                AdS/CFT and Geometry.

                The aim of this talk is to create a bridge between math and physics 
                regarding the study of higher spin algebras. First, I will give some 
                Physical motivation for the interest on these algebras. Secondly, we 
                will define this algebras in various dimensions, with a particular 
                attention in the case of 3 and 4 dimensions. Also, we will interpret 
                them physically as global symmetries or as a gauge symmetry if we 
                add one more dimension to our system. Lastly, we will see explicitly 
                how to construct them and illustrate it with examples.</p>

                about Higher-spin theories, twistor theory, and deformation theory.

                In his talk, we will study the deformation of complex structures 
                on complex manifolds based on the Spencer-Kodaira theory, which 
                has significant applications in twistor theory. In particular, we 
                will show how the deformation of twistor geometry can lead to 
                various self-dual theories on spacetime via the Penrose transform.</p>
